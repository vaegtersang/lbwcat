What is dissatisfying to Link about his work?
    Unreliability of schedule
      -- not a lot of forecast of when he'll be needed for meetings more than two days out
    Number of meetings (Internal to Castle)
      -- Are the troops inspired? Do they need Link's leadership (No! He was one kid who thwacked a bunch of things)
    Number of meetings (being showpony to foreign potentate)
      -- Often requested that he present a gift to Zelda on behalf of a dignitary. Sometimes even asked to convey gifts from a dignitary _standing there_ to Z because it's somehow fancier if the Hero helps offer them.

What is dissatisfying to Zelda about her work?
    No Privacy
    Almost all publicity all the time
    Along side that -- somehow needs to juggle all administration, taxes, valuations, etc. etc. etc.
