  \subsection{Problems/Motivations}
  This poor guy is tired as hell and still has obligations. I am going to be spending a lot of time playing up his cattiness, but one respect that he is distinctly un-feline is his generosity and willingness, at any moment, to do work. When H.L. Mencken observed that ``[he] was born, happily, with no more public spirit than a cat,''\footnote{\textsc{H.L.~Mencken, Newspaper Days: 1899--1906}, at v, vii (1941).} I can think of no statement less apposite to Link. A good deal of this story is this poor nut learning to set some boundaries. 
  \subsection{Character Questions}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item\textit{What’s the lie your character says most often?}
    \item\textit{How loosely or strictly do they use the word ‘friend’?} Link falls on the stricter side, and though he has warm relations with lots of people, I think he only counts you as a friend if he spends subtantial time with you. Given the way his destiny cuts severely into leisure time, I think this means most of his friends are either in the Royal Guard or are people with whom he has worked overseas (friends in Labrynna, Friends in Hytopia, etc.). Within Hyrule, I think he counts Gulley and Irene as friends outside of his new work.
    \item\textit{How often do they show their genuine emotions to others versus just the audience knowing?}Link will often put on a brave face, but won't conceal the direction of his emotion. So fear may come out as mild concern, but it won't be completley hidden. 
    \item\textit{What’s a hobby they used to have that they miss?}
    \item\textit{Can they cry on command? If so, what do they think about to make it happen?}
    \item\textit{What’s their favorite [insert anything] that they’ve never recommended to anyone before?}The stream of colors as he crosses worlds
    \item\textit{What would you (mun) yell in the middle of a crowd to find them? What would their best friend and/or romantic partner yell?}
    \item\textit{How loose is their use of the phrase ‘I love you’?} Paradoxically I think this is looser for him than who he counts as his friends: he's completely ready to tell any of his friends that they're loved, and in addition he has at least four or five different mentor and parent figures he doesn't think of as friends who he would say he loves as well (Blacksmith, Wife and , the Witch, and Sahasrala). 
    \item\textit{Do they give tough love or gentle love most often? Which do they prefer to receive?}Mostly being raised by the Blacksmith and his family, Link is very used to tough love, but I think wouldn't mind a little bit 
    \item\textit{What fact do they excitedly tell everyone about at every opportunity?}
    \item\textit{If someone was impersonating them, what would friends / family ask or do to tell the difference?}
    \item\textit{What’s something that makes them laugh every single time? Be specific!}
    \item\textit{When do they fake a smile? How often?}
    \item\textit{How do they put out a candle?}

    \item\textit{Who do they love truly, 100\% unconditionally (if anyone)?}
    \item\textit{What would they do if stuck in a room with the person they’ve been avoiding?}
    \item\textit{Who do they like as a person but hate their work? Vice versa, whose work do they like but don’t like the person?}
    \item\textit{What common etiquette do they disagree with? Do they still follow it?}
    \item\textit{What simple activity that most people do / can do scares your character?}
    \item\textit{What do they feel guilty for that the other person(s) doesn’t / don’t even remember?}
    \item\textit{Did they take a cookie from the cookie jar? What kind of cookie was it?}
    \item\textit{What subject / topic do they know a lot about that’s completely useless to the direct plot?}
    \item\textit{How would they respond to being fired by a good boss?}
    \item\textit{What’s the worst gift they ever received? How did they respond?}
    \item\textit{What do they tell people they want? What do they actually want?}
    \item\textit{How do they respond when someone doesn’t believe them?}
    \item\textit{When they make a mistake and feel bad, does the guilt differ when it’s personal versus when it’s professional?}
    \item\textit{When do they feel the most guilt? How do they respond to it?}
    \item\textit{If they committed one petty crime / misdemeanor, what would it be? Why?}
    \item\textit{How do they greet someone they dislike / hate?}
