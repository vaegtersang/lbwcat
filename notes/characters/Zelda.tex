  \subsection{Problems/Motivations}
  \subsubsection{Hello in There}
  \subsubsection{Attitude toward Destiny}The Goddesses have a plan, which is unfolding even now and this is a source of enduring comfort to Zelda. The Goddesses will, at times of need, provide means to address whatever problem -- large or small -- arises. On this read, it is important to be alert for divine gifts the Goddesses might send, and to carry out one's duties sedulously, but there isn't an implied striving or pressure to go out into the world and find what you should be doing.

  \begin{quote}Castle Guard
  Did you see the paintings here in the hall? They tell you of Hyrule’s oldest legend.

  But all that happened so long ago. Sometimes I wish I could go back to the past to see if it’s true!\end{quote}

  \begin{quote}
  Castle Guard
  The princess runs the whole country all by herself. Can you imagine, and at her age too?

  When I was that young, I spent my days doing nothing but chasing Cuccos.

  \begin{quote}Rumor guy
  Everyone, not just the rumor guy but attendants and servants too, seems to read romantic intrigues into Zelda's nighttime wanderings. When someone follows Zelda one night, they find "[the princess] stopped in front of a large painting on display in the center of the castle. And she stood there just staring up at the painting for 10 minutes. And then went back to her room."  
  The painting, we're told, depicts "a hero and princess from several generations ago cuddling in one another’s arms\ldots" and "The painting brought out a look of such admiration that had never been seen before in the princess." We do not have to accept either characterization at face value. It seems likely, though not certain, the large painting is painting V of the sequence we see at the start of the game. It shows a Zelda, gazing up in wonderment at a Link and it could easily be given romantic overtones but it does not show them cuddled up. There might be another painting elsewhere in the castle, but it seems equally possible that this is a case of the image being refracted in popular vision, like Mennochio and the Fioretto della bibbia.\end{quote}


  You know what? Scratch that skeptical note. Yeah. She \emph{is} projecting a lot of fantasies on to this poor green guy! Honestly fair. If I was running a country all by myself at 12 or 13 I'd want company too, and I'd be a little crazy by 15 or 16 as well. She lives alone in a castle and has an attendant to talk to and no one her age!
  And then all her life there's lots of Destiny talk that she's going to be really close with this green guy? Sign her up!
  \ldots only they don't seem to be?
  He's nice, she's nice, they talk idly, but it's transactional.
  And empty transactional. Pleasure doing business with you.
  The rumor monger in LBW hints pretty well that There's a level of romance and yearning on this one and I'm not saying otherwise, but man I think I'd have a yearning that runs the full gamut if I were that locked up, and I think there's a level of that ``want to be/want to date'' confusion with Link who is so adept at charming people along his travels and so naturally social. Anyway, I think there's a relation here but it is oddly parasocial and projective.
