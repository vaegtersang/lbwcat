OK SO dead honest I think a big draw of this story ab initio was the whole cat familiar premise and getting them to work together and realize they'd fallen for eachother like months and months back, alongside some poking at monarchy and that's all well and good but I feel like you're writing nearly everything but that? WHY?

- At a fundamental level I think the working enviroment for them being sweet and working together is under-defined. Working at what? Irene being witch-crown princess? Cool, how does having a cat help? Well, I guess doing the witch half is easy since there's a clear tradition to semi-draw on there. But how does having a cat help with being crown princess? Espio-nyage? Notably lots of this isn't necessarily working *together* it's Link doing her favors. 
   Which I think might itself be part of the sticking point. Working together in a way that advances each of their goals implies they have independent goals. I'm not sure what's on Link's agenda other than "get back to being not a cat" -- which is _also_ on Irene's agenda, alongside "fake being Witch-Crown Princess so this kingdom doesn't fall apart" although truthfully I also think it's important to note that a lot of what Link was doing before wasn't really on _his_ agenda either -- he was doing it out of a sense of duty, a sense which is commendable but (in the event) misplaced since all these tasks were falling on him out of some misplaced sense of destiny.

   I think there are two realizations Link can come to over the course of this extended cat situation:
      - He enjoys approximately the same class of support tasks when he's doing them for Irene, which he did not for Z. This isn't _just_ romantic favoritism, also at play here is Z herself took on a large number of regal tasks simply because convention thought a royal should be doing them but was not particularly invested in them. Meanwhile Irene dives headlong into both halves of the job because most of it is of interest to her (various diplomatic stints and judicial ceremonies a bit less so, but I also think the Witch-Crown Princess thing makes the diplomatic shape of things more tolerable), so her investment means he gets to help people with things that matter to _them_ (and also yeah he really likes the person he's helping).
     
      - At the same time, one person can't run everything, so I think Irene being Witch Crown-Princess is doomed to failure and is an enormous time-sink for both of them. By the end, when everyone actually has a smidge of free time because the role of Witch Crown-Princess has been split, shared, and delegated I think he gets to recover fairly mundane interests and work of his own, incl. smithing and some archival research. 
   An upshot of the sequence of these is that Z may need to get back earlier in the story than I realized. Her branch of this is also still extremely under-defined so I don't fully know what impacts that means, though. Following the logic thread above, and the implicit idea that there's plenty of normal work in a country and very little that *needs* to be done by One Brave Hero or One Wise Monarch, and those destinies are really more about handling Weird Exogenous Shocks it might be good if --- ah crap I've lost my train of thought
