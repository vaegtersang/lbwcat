Hi again, and thank you so much for lending my your inbox for screaming. I can't tell you how much I appreciate this. Before I start 
i) this... got longer in writing and may not be super easy to read on Tumblr, so I've also got a copy up, along with all my other project notes and snippets of this idea as I've written them out, on github at https://github.com/vaegtersang/lbwcat/rant.md

Anyway, here goes:
## Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaggggghhh!

_Never_ have my characters mutinied so completely or violently against the story I thought I was writing. I'm not sure there's anything left of my original idea.

I _thought_ what I was going to be writing was a brief, goofy romp, set a few years after LBW. Now discovered as a legendary Hero, Link has been working as a public face of Hylian Royalty. Town has monster problems? Or an ancient curse? Or just needs to feel appreciated by HRH Zelda Eunomia Hyrule IV? The Crown sends Link to solve it. He also appears in a number of big fancy annual ceremonies, and that's all well and good until a bit of magic goes astray hours before one such event and he's changed into a cat. He and friends -- especially Zelda, Irene, and Gulley, with much briefer appereances by Ravio, and Hilda -- struggle to figure out how to turn him back while also keeping to an ethos of "the show must go on" and this all is appropriately ridiculous. Along the way Link realizes he's been over-working himself and needs some time off, he and friends figure out how to change him back in time, he goes on a vaction afterward, lesson learned, comedy ends hapily.

It's all turned to angst and everyone's just miserable. It's also all turned _shippy_, which I am uncertain as to my ability to write generally, and am _extra_-diffident about when it comes to the ship I have unwittingly boarded. Beyond those unexpected changes to tone and characters, the story's gone and sprouted Elaborate Plot... but only just _enough_ Elaborate Plot to give everyone problems without any clues to resolving them. I'm not even sure Link is the main character anymore!  Stories taking sudden left turns is common, I know, I know, but this one has taken so many and all to places where I'm just not sure of myself.

I think it all started unravelling when I tried foreshadowing the cat thing. "Wouldn't it be fun to give LBW Link a very cattish personality from the outset?" I thought. "What could go wrong?" I thought. So I started with the gimmes: love of naps, love of sunbeams. Then I made him an enormous drama queen of the "You _Kick_ Miette?!" variety and that was delightful to imagine. It also had unexpected consequences. Link's initial problem was that he's overworked being a big famous hero of legend, but a duty to represent the Crown means he's severely constrained in how he can act "on the job." So now he's both overworked _and_ must suppress his melodramatic personality most the time. It also burdens his friendship with Zelda. Decorum blocks him from being himself when he sees her on professional occaisions which, since she also has an "Always On" job, is all occaisions. Their public roles straight-jacketing their friendship creates a third problem to solve -- they deserve more friend time! --and also moves a lot of the story's intial interactions to establish his cattishness to Gulley and Irene. With Gulley this largely winds up being him complaining about his workload and getting gentle teasing back about his love for lazing. With Irene, though, the cat motif suddenly took on a different character. And, well...

## Irene/Link

I don't think these two idiot workaholics realize they're perfect for eachother, but they are. They definitely don't notice they've already stumbled 78% of the way into a relationship, but they have. They might see it better if they didn't both have so much travelling to do, but as it is. Link comes back from Royal duties, having disappeared into remote corners of the country for weeks, and immediately bee-line to the Witch's hut to say hello, elf-ears perked up and walking faster than normal. When Irene's out travelling herself he drops small souvenirs on her doorstep: sometimes magic baubles, usually parts of monsters (carefully bottled!) for potion research. But while the dead birds on door steps and showing up out of nowhere barn cat dressing is immense fun to write, the more important finding is that they share a deep working partnership; Irene still gives him lifts when he's tired or has a very long way to travel, and makes sure he's stocked on red and green potion. In addition to the monster parts he drops off, Link goes out of his way to talk up her potions when he's travelling abroad so she gets new customers. He also made her her own cauldron to conclude his blacksmithing apprenticeship. The practical aspects of this are important, small practial gestures mean a lot to them, but it's not strictly transactional. They're each motivated to do the favors in part because they're awe of the other: Link isn't only talking Irene up to do her a favor, he also just plain can't believe how ambitious and dedicated Irene is to her craft, and how impressive the advances she's made in potion brewing already. Going the other direction, Irene admires how resourceful Link is to be set out into Hyrule with a few leased items and barely any instruction and to turn that into a full complement of adventuring gear. They're also good for each other because, despite them being terrible workaholics, they give eachother a space to rest. This too is a meeting of practical aid and personal attachment. Each can do things which save the other substantial time in their work -- Irene can transport Link in hours what would take him days on foot, Link can help source monster parts that would take Irene considerable time to hunt and track down on her own -- and then with that newly freed time, a tendency to pry the other away from their work and take a break now that they've showed up and saved them so much time. I don't know how compelling this sounds as summary, but it's compelling in my head, and I think I'm stuck here now.[^defense]

If they're so compelling a ship, why aren't they already together? For Link, I-- don't have a good answer why he wouldn't have raised the subject of his feelings, save maybe that he has not figured the obvious out yet, but that feels more like a convenient excuse I'm making than an in-character reason. I know Irene's answer, though; she's afraid that if they were to become a couple, his reputation would swallow her up and to the rest of the world she'd just be the sage who fell in love with Link this iteration of the cycle, never thought of as a talented witch again. She already has this problem in miniature; half of Hyrule knows her more for the two weeks she was a Sage than all the things she's done since. And while Link is dear to Irene, so are her ambitions to be recognized as a witch _par excellence_.  She'd never cut off contact with him to pursue her dream, but stay good friends? Maybe. She isn't sure. So things stay how they are, and once again the Hypertrophied sense of mythic history in this Hyrule makes the people in the myth unhappy.[^irene_hypertrophiedmyth] 

## 

- practical reasons, they have meaningful loving interactions despite the constant travel, but travel is a barrier to naming since shouldn't couples be more together?
- self-defeating reasons. (Link wrongly believes Irene isn't interested in a ship until established as a witch, apprenticeship completed)
- ambivalence reasons Maybe punt on explaining this



   

  [Additional note to self, I think this might be a good way to put L and I back together after the wish separates them. Irene wakes up, panics, immediately works herself to illness. The witch is summoned and she brings her cat with her.]
 
 [^defense]: In my defense I am struggling to keep the word count of this pargraph limited, so it's a more lifeless summary than the one I want to give, and I had to edit out a _lot_ of headcanons to get to this draft.

 [^irene_hypertrophiedmyth]: I think Irene struggles with that hypertrophied sense of myth as well a little bit, in that she's got the ingrained cultural presumptions that go with knowing the myth of the hero too and -- subconsciously, not in any way she could put into words -- assumes Link is going to wind up with Zelda, right, so why pursue something that probably can't be?
