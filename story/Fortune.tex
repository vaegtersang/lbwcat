\noindent \lettrine[lines=3,loversize=0.039]{I}{rene looked} up\marginnote{Quick note to self: I think we have two problems with this draft. i) I don't think this gives enough room to Irene's growing problem with fate vs her own reputation ii) Cats are charming assholes, and I have Link behaving very cattishly here, but I'm not sure it's endearing in the way it'd be if he were already a cat.} from her work, bit her lip, and glowered at the myriad suns and distant galaxies scattered across the black. If there were portents in the stars -- and she was most certainly not conceding that there were -- Irene wanted nothing to do with them. The very premise had something insulting in it. Reading palms or tea leaves, their subjects as rough and varied as the lives they predicted, required work and more than a little art. The charting of stars required a few pages of records and maybe an hour of computation. Irene could change lead into gold, or a bead into a bandicoot, but not a life into arithmetic, and whatever sense of professionalism might keep a better witch from crowing at an astrologer's failures, Irene lacked it -- and it was far too late to worry about professionalism, anyway.

``Net pull is weak, two or three--'' the astrologer mumbled. Irene hadn't a clue what two or three was measured in, and could only guess that it was stars doing the pulling, but he seemed to be talking for his own sake at the moment ``-- and it's\ldots five degrees, no ten toward{\ldots} um{\ldots}''

A turtle glid serenely through the cosmos, before coming to an amenably smooth rock at the end of the visible universe and climbing half-way out. Behind it trailed a rippling wake that washed the million points of light from visibility; Irene beamed.

``That's interference,'' Link whined, ``this go doesn't count."  

``Does so." 

``Oh come on. I can't finish the stars now until it settles, and you're still reading my palm" She wasn't; she was too giddy.

``If you don't like it you're always free to use the actual thing,'' Irene said, motioning upwards to the sky above them, boxed in by the courtyard's walls and the boughs of trees reaching in and up. ``I'm sure you can do something with those clouds. I didn't have to enchant this pool for you, you know. I'm already giving you a leg up.''

``But--'' 

Irene scooped water from the pool with her free hand and flicked. 

``Okay! Okay! Fine,'' he said in a voice clearly indicating he was anything but, and indeed might die at any moment, but he bounced back quickly ``there really is a reading to take from the clouds. They filter the stars' influence, so depending which are covered right now\ldots'' and back he went to  peering out intently into space, his lip twitching in consternation at meanings she did not credit were there, not really, but he gawked with such conviction that she wondered, however briefly, if there might be something to the starry mumbo-jumbo he had dragged back from the drablands.  returned to his muttering, she to the surfeit of lines on his palm.

 ``Stop squirming,'' 
 % TODO: Expand on this, give I a few minutes watching and enjoying L's consternation (which means dropping the surfeit of lines line)
% TODO Maybe here, but not necessarily here, let Link struggle a little more with the numbers cycling inconclusively.
\subsubsection{Draft \thefragment.2}
Once on her broom she had looked down over Zora's River and realized the hills of eastern Hyrule were ancient riverbanks whose river had wandered off.%
    \marginnote{\textit{Cf.} \textit{Ancient courses within the Mississippi River meander belt} (illustration) \textit{in} \textsc{Harold N.\ Fisk, U.S.\ Army Corps of Eng'rs., Geological Investigation of the Alluvial Valley of the Lower Mississippi River} (1944), \textit{available at} \url{https://biotech.law.lsu.edu/climate/mississippi/fisk/plate_22-2.pdf} (real example of same phenomenon). This makes Zora's River an alluvial distributary system, which isn't supported by evidence from \textsc{LBW} or \textsc{LttP}, but I like this metaphor enough I think I'll take artistic license.}
Rolling hills curlicued around the ghost of an oxbow, while three miles west the River ran straight. A bluff overlooked a valley that once must have been part of the Eastern Palace's moat, and now the River wended lazily around Hyrule Castle. Where now it bent west, in some age or other past it bowed east, and so on in a thousand variations on the same watery journey, always emptying into Lake Hylia. Link's palm was like that. What she initially thought was a severely bifrucated Life line, crossed and pockmarked by occlusions was, in  fact scores upon scores of Life lines all run together. Once realized, it shocked her how easily she picked out her Link%
    \reversemarginpar\marginnote{``Her Link'' is too possessive for the start of the story, but I'd like something similar -- a little bit of a slip of language -- something more personal than ``this Link'' that hints where feelings are going. They're already quite close}
from the tangle, and could trace the line as it turned toward the Mount of Apollo, like all the hundred others. His Heart line ran deep and clear, which was no surprise to her, and like all the others it doubled back up to the Mount of Jupiter before running a short distance and vanishing on the pads below his ring finger. A thousand meandering variations, all ending in the same place. The flow of time was cruel, indeed.

``--the brightness of {\Gr Âµ}-thulan\ldots{} or the Peninsular Star? I didn't know it bothered you.'' There was a note of genuine apology in his voice.

``What?'' It was only after asking that Irene realized she had flinched, and that Link thought it was something he'd said. She was going to have to explain, now, when she had only the vaguest preomonition of what was even wrong -- and even if she did understand, what could say? ``Oh, not that. Don't get me wrong the Labrynnan names are dry as a \emph{bone}, but-- Link, there's something terrible in your future.''  

``Future in the next few days? Weeks?'' he said, handling doom with a calm that, on reflection, should not have surprised her.

``Further out than that.'' She was sure of that much, at least, but what was she allowed to tell? ``\ldots More like years.''

Link gave a simple resolute nod, and it perturbed her how much even in this he seemed to be accepting an assignment. 

``Then I have both time and excellent counsel.''

What would Gram do? Not be caught in this situation in the first place because she wouldn't tell fortunes for a lark.
