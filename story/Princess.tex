\section{Princess}
\begin{fragment}
Irene woke in darkness and waited for her eyes to adjust. It was unseasonably warm for a morning in early spring, especially when the sun had not yet risen, and she wondered at what weather might have rolled in along with the unexpected heat. Wind? Rainstorms? But there was no faint wail of air through the cottage shutters, nor the gravelly hiss of droplets on the roof. Birdsong filtered through the closed windows, which settled the matter -- if there had been storms they were gone now. It also meant that there should at least be the beginnings of a dawn outside, so why could she not see yet?

She sat up straight and the quilt, a scratchy thing as old as the Great Witch Syrup, slid with uncharacteristic fluidity onto her knees still in covers. Extending her arm to her left -- slowly, so as not to hit Gram if she was sitting awake -- Irene outstretched her fingers and tried to move a bit of flame from the hearth's embers into the wick of the candle they kept by the bedside. Warmth neither came in to her nor flowed out. Irene fumbled around in the substratum of all things for the objects she was trying to connect and found nothing. No candle, no hearth. With nothing to do she let her arm flopp back down, and when her palm hit the mattress she noticed the third absence. No Gram.

Irene leapt, or tried to. The side of her jaw flashed in pain and the bone of her wrist hit hard against something cold and smooth. She kicked and kicked uselessly against the air and her foot, still tangled in blankets, moved half an inch at most. Her other hand, the one that wasn't stinging, had also somehow smothered itself in blankets and it flopped like a fish as she tried to reach for something, anything in the dark to help her get her bearings back. It brushed something alternatingly soft and solid in a corded texture. What on earth was \emph{that}, why did this quilt go on \emph{forever} and where was Gram and \emph{why couldn't she see?} 

The curtains around her bed opened with a terrible rattle and Irene had to pull the quilt back over her face to shield against the brightness of the sun. She blinked in discomfort a few moments before squinting in preemptive defense and slowly lowering the cover.\marginnote{This needs a rework because if she pulls the quilt over her head she can't see people entering or the room she's in.}

``Highness?" An attendant, entering from the far side of the room, asked with admirably masked confusion.

``Wise one?"\marginnote{I'm also considering: \emph{Wite}? and \emph{Witestre}? (female cognates of Old English \emph{Wita}, wise man, advisor) and \emph{Wicce}? (Old English for witch).} Another voice, stationed somewhere off to Irene's left, asked with no mask at all.

\emph{I'm not a}-- but plainly she was, so Irene swallowed her panic and gathered up her most cooly regal voice. ``We are awake,'' she announced, raising her voice to be heard over the quilt's muffling. The voice out of sight burst into peals of laughter. 

``And uninjured?''

He'd probably also be able to interpret the symbols on the tracery of the window. He's still in Labrynna for two days, but maybe if she ambushed him on his return before he could be sent off again. 
% - Shoves herself out of bed. Her feet touch the ground of her bedroom.
% - ...Her Room?
% - Her bedroom was a small, book-drowned thing with wooden floors. It was debatable whether she had a bedroom at all, since if she did it was also a kitchen, study, receiving room, and Gram's bedroom as well. This was nothing of the kind.

\begin{fragment}
On her third day, Irene came to the conclusion that Being Witch-Crown Princess was an endless exercise in costumingtu. She was still unsure whether she held one title or two, but she was beginning to believe it must be two because her attendants only ever helped her dress for the princess half, and then left her to find an appropriate cloak and hat by herself. But then what witch owned so many different styles of cloaks and hats?

and how ever was she supposed to fit her crown over the point of her hat without assistance?
