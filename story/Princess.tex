\section{Princess}
\begin{fragment}
Irene woke in complete darkness and waited for her eyes to adjust. It was unseasonably warm for a morning in early spring, especially when the sun was not already out, and she wondered for a minute at what weather might have rolled in earlier in the night along with the unexpected heat. Wind? Rainstorms? If so, where was the faint wail of air through the cottage shutters? And why could she not see yet?

She sat up striaght and the quilt, a scratchy thing as old as the Great Witch Syrup, slid with uncharacteristic fluidity onto her knees still in covers.  There was a candle on the night stand, and she began patting the mattress with her right arm, looking for the spot where ticking gave way to open air. Getting to the candle without waking Gram would be no problem; lighting it, on the other hand... But she was speaking too soon again, beacuse finding the night stand \emph{was} proving a problem. No matter how far she patted out to her side, the mattress continued on. Lying back down flat and stretching her arms to their furthest reach, she still found no edge, but her palm found something soft and ribbed which she seized upon for inspection. 

The curtains around her bed opened with a wooden rattle and Irene had to pull the quilt over her face to shield against the brightness of the sun.

On her third day, Irene came to the conclusion that Being Witch-Crown Princess was an endless exercise in costumingtu. She was still unsure whether she held one title or two, but she was beginning to believe it must be two because her attendants only ever helped her dress for the princess half, and then left her to find an appropriate cloak and hat by herself. But then what witch owned so many different styles of cloaks and hats?

and how ever was she supposed to fit her crown over the point of her hat without assistance?
