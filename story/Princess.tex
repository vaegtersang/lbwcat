\section{Princess}
\begin{fragment}
Irene woke in darkness and waited for her eyes to adjust. It was unseasonably warm for a morning in early spring, especially when the sun was not yet up, and she wondered at what weather might have rolled in along with the unexpected heat. Wind? Rainstorms? If so, where was the faint wail of air through the cottage shutters, or the gravelly hiss of droplets on the roof? And why could she not see yet?

She sat up striaght and the quilt, a scratchy thing as old as the Great Witch Syrup, slid with uncharacteristic fluidity onto her knees still in covers. Extending her arm to her left -- slowly, so as not to hit Gram if she was sitting awake -- Irene outstretched her fingers and tried to move a bit of flame from the hearth into the wick of the candle Gram kept by the bedside. Warmth neither came in nor flowed out. Irene fumbled around in the substratum of all things for the objects she was trying to connect and found nothing. No candle, no hearth. With nothing to do she let her arm flopp back down, and when her palm hit the mattress she noticed the third absence. No Gram.

- Hops out of bed, even blind, at this realization. 
   - feet hit the floor, colid, smooth, unexpected but not processed because
   - rest of her is stuck in curtains, smothered where she stands, arms flail, legs kick. kick. kick again. 
   - rolls out the other end into the cavernous room.
 - "Highness?" An attendant, entering from the far side of the room 
 - "Wise one?" Another witch, tending the cauldron -- her cauldron, the one Link made for her -- by the hearth, which is not where it should be.


The curtains around her bed opened with a terrible rattle and Irene had to pull the quilt back over her face to shield against the brightness of the sun. She blinked in discomfort a few moments before squinting in preemptive defense and slowly lowering the cover as she looked back up at a rose window set into the ceiling.

 - Divided into seven, one for each color of the rainbow, natural phenomenon motifs in each
    Don't think it'll come up but:
      - Red (Fire)
      - Orange (Fairies, Din-Aligned)
      - Yellow (Light)
      - Green (Plant growth)
      - Blue (Ice)
      - Indigo (Water)
      - Violet (Fairies, Nayru-aligned)
 -Five Dragons curling through the panels in double-loops. They're analemmata, but where's she supposed to view from? And how to tell which dragon meant which time? Link would know. He'd probably also be able to interpret the symbols on the tracery of the window. He's still in Labrynna for two days, but maybe if she ambushed him on his return before he could be sent off again. 
 - Shoves herself out of bed. Her feet touch the ground of her bedroom.
 - ...Her Room?
 - Her bedroom was a small, book-drowned thing with wooden floors. It was debatable whether she had a bedroom at all, since if she did it was also a kitchen, study, receiving room, and Gram's bedroom as well. This was nothing of the kind. 


 It's a bedroom, Jim, but not as we know it


%- sun is coming down through an elabroate stained glass window
%- ...which has an analemma on it. And other markings. Link would be able to identify what time it was, which was moot because he was in the barracks. Maybe she could make a sketch to bring to--
%- ...where is she???

\begin{fragment}
On her third day, Irene came to the conclusion that Being Witch-Crown Princess was an endless exercise in costumingtu. She was still unsure whether she held one title or two, but she was beginning to believe it must be two because her attendants only ever helped her dress for the princess half, and then left her to find an appropriate cloak and hat by herself. But then what witch owned so many different styles of cloaks and hats?

and how ever was she supposed to fit her crown over the point of her hat without assistance?
