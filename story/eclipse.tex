\section{Eclipse}
The sun glinted off the myriad glazes on the ceramics Irene had set out before her, and again she stole an envious look into the Witch's hut where Gram, by dint of seniority, conducted her consultations indoors. Squinting away the glare, she reached for a blue solution -- not yet a full potion, but give it two monster tails and time on the fire and it could be -- and an empty jar, into which she decanted half. 

``Give `im two sips of this an evening for the fever 'til symptoms improve and--'' she was blanking again, how did Gram keep them all straight ``what'd you say the other thing was?''

``My daughter needs--''

``-- a potion of invulnerabilty! --''\quad
``-- an antiseptic. What? \emph{Ele}!'' %reminder: Ele short for Eleuthera.

It took Irene a moment to parse out the two different voices, and a moment more to understand `invulnerability' though the child's mispronunciation, before turning towards Ele. 

``What do you need invulnerability for?''

``I'm going to ride a lynel,'' she answered with an indifferent confidence that suggested the lynel-riding was merely instrumental in some grander scheme she did not deign to share.

``Not if you have a festering wound you aren't. Where are you injured?''

The girl rolled her sleeve up to reveal an elbow covered in abraisions, with splinters at her wrist. ``A lynel shot me and I died,'' she explained. Irene was very proud of not laughing aloud and over Ele's head her mother mouthed `she fell.' Irene wondered whether she ought stop to get the true story out of the girl, to build good patient habits, but another look at the line wending its way around the hut decided against it -- too many other patients to slow down. ``But you can treat arrowwounds!'' the girl chirped with an enthusiasm rare in the recently deceased. ``They say the Hero got shot full of them and you pulled them out and healed him.'' 

Irene froze as the image of Link, bloodied and skin-pierced from head to toe, formed unbidden in her mind. Her blood ran either cold or hot, she was too startled to say which before managing ``You must be thinking of someone else because I don't know a thing about that if it happened, and I certainly wasn't the one to tend `im, but I do know you shouldn't yank arrows out of a person.''

It was a brusquer answer than a child deserved, but if she didn't stop the rumor now she feared half her consultations would be nothing but questions about Link's heroics. Still, she made sure to offer an apologetic smile to both girl and mother as she fetched another small jar. She handed the jar to the mother and made sure to address Ele while explaining. 

``Pummelled verderoot in bosun's oil.\footnote{The origin of the name ``bosun's oil'' for chuu jelly emulsified in fairy spring water is obscure.} Apply it once now, and then when you wake up and go to bed for three days. Might sting a little, but it's an ant bite next to a lynel's bow.'' 

Ele looked at the jar solemly while her mother offered a thanks and a blue rupee. Irene had been hoping for a red, but accepted the payment and wished them both safe travels back to town. 

``Next!'' she shouted.
