% So why is it that ruler of Hyrule and High Witch exist in personal union?
%    sub-question: why is there a high witch at all, why are they organized now?
%    - I think the answer is "Irene wished it that way inadvertently" 


HRH Hylia Themiskopa Hyrule has twins.
Which should be Crown Princess is unclear, but raises both, each day flipping a coin to see who is crown princess that day. Other child left free to roam and wander the kingdom. On their 19th birthday,  one takes on the mantle of Zelda Archesophia Hyrule III and the other, having befriended an elderly witch in her extracurricular life, goes on to learn the cthonic arts. When HRH Zelda Hyrule III has her own daughter, she is both the successor to the throne and, as niece of a powerful witch, next in line for the cthonic arts too. 

That's the cleanest version anyway.
